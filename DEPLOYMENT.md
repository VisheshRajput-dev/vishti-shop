## üåê Backend Deployment on Railway

Railway is a modern platform that makes deploying Node.js applications simple with automatic deployments from GitHub.

### Step 1: Prepare Your Backend

1. **Push your code to GitHub**
   ```bash
   cd shop/backend
   git init  # If not already a git repo
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Verify package.json has start script**
   - Ensure `package.json` has:
     ```json
     {
       "scripts": {
         "start": "node server.js",
         "dev": "nodemon server.js"
       }
     }
     ```

- Update `server.js` CORS to include your Vercel URL
- Commit and push the change to trigger Railway redeploy
- Clear browser cache and try again

#### 2. Environment Variables Not Loading
**Symptoms:** Features don't work, API calls fail

**Solutions:**
- Double-check variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- For Vercel: Ensure variables are set for "Production" environment
- For Railway: Verify variables are added in the correct service
- Redeploy after adding/updating variables
- **Important:** Vercel requires a redeploy for new environment variables to take effect

#### 3. Database Connection Issues
**Symptoms:** Backend logs show MongoDB connection errors

**Solutions:**
- Verify `MONGODB_URI` in Railway is correct
- Check MongoDB Atlas Network Access allows all IPs (0.0.0.0/0)
- Verify database user has correct permissions
- Check connection string format (includes password and database name)

#### 4. Build Failures
**Symptoms:** Deployment fails during build

**Solutions:**
- Check Railway/Vercel build logs for specific errors
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Test build locally first: `npm run build`
- Check for missing environment variables during build

#### 5. Payment Integration Issues
**Symptoms:** Razorpay payment fails

**Solutions:**
- Verify Razorpay keys are correct (Live vs Test)
- Check that both backend and frontend have the same Key ID
- Verify backend has the Key Secret
- Test in Razorpay test mode first
- Check Railway logs for payment errors

#### 6. Firebase Admin Initialization Error
**Symptoms:** Backend crashes with error: `Cannot find module './serviceAccountKey.json'`

**Solutions:**

- Add `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` environment variable:
  1. Download your `serviceAccountKey.json` from Firebase Console
  2. Open the JSON file and copy the entire content
  3. Paste it into Railway as the value for `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY`
  4. Make sure it's a valid JSON string (no extra quotes needed)
- **Alternative:** If JSON approach doesn't work, use individual fields:
  - Set `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`, `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL`, `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`, etc.
- After adding the variable, Railway will auto-redeploy
- Check logs to verify "Firebase Admin initialized successfully" message

#### 7. Firebase Authentication Issues
**Symptoms:** Login/signup not working

**Solutions:**
- Verify all Firebase environment variables are set in Vercel
- Check Firebase authorized domains include your Vercel URL
- Verify Firebase Authentication is enabled
- Check browser console for specific Firebase errors

#### 8. Image Upload Issues
**Symptoms:** Images not uploading to Cloudinary

**Solutions:**
- Verify Cloudinary credentials in Railway
